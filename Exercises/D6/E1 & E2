E1: Git Review

1. Initiates git on the flder you are currently in

2. It adds the file into the git stage file while git commit saves the file into your local repository.

3. Staged files are files you are currently working in and you replace them every thime you save it to stage. The committed files are files that are saved and will be saved under a different 'description' you give them every time you save it. So it doesn't replace files and has all the files. 

4. git add . 

5. git checkout -- <filename>

6. it saves all your older versions. So when you made a mistake in a file that you staged, the committed file is still available. 

7. Git reset

8. Esc
